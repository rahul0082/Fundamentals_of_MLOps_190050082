# Assignment 1
## Part 1
1. **AIOps**:
 It tries to automate DevOps by troubleshooting and automating tasks at several stages.
 It uses machine learning to find the root cause of inefficiencies in IT operations. 
 It helps DevOps and DataOps teams to choose what to automate and predict performance problems, do root analysis and finding anomalies.\
 **MLOps**:
	MLOps has nothing to do with DevOps. It is the process of taking an experimental Machine Learning model into a production system.
  It focuses on creating an automated pipeline to get machine learning models into production. 
  Itâ€™s a way to manage and streamline the building, deployment and maintenance of ML algorithms rather than using them to find anomalies and flaws in IT sector.\
2. **Interpretable Machine Learning**:<br /> One of the problems of ML models is sometimes their output is not human-understandable, it's like a black box model.
But we often need the output to be interpretable.
  Sometimes output isn't the only thing that is needed. Eg: in the medical field, it is not only important to predict the clinical outcome of a patient,
   but also to quantify the influence of the drug and at the same time take sex, age, and other features into account in an interpretable way.\
   This interpretation is easy incase of linear regression. Every feature has a weight associated with it. This weight gives the intuition
   of what extent this feature contributes to the final outcome.
